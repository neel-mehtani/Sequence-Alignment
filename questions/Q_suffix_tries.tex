{\bf [25 points] Suffix Tries}\\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw the \textbf{suffix \underline{trie}} for the sequence ``GACGA". Include a picture of your trie in your write-up.

    Add your solution here.

    \item Why is the termination character `\$' necessary? (\textit{Hint:} try removing it from the leaves of your completed suffix trie, and explain any issues that arise). You should make a general statement about why \$ is necessary for Suffix Tries, for any string, not just this example. The example given here might be a special case where it might not be necessary but that is coincidental. It may help to look at another short string, like ``banana".

    \begin{solution}
    Add your solution here.
    \end{solution}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item Suppose that we are interested in finding the \textbf{longest repeated substring} in the reference string of length $N$. For example, if we used the above sequence as the reference string, the longest repeated substring would be ``GA". Explain how we can do this using suffix tries. What is the runtime complexity?
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{solution}
    Add your solution here.
    \end{solution}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item Suppose that we modify the above problem to finding the longest repeated substring with \textbf{at least $K$ occurrences}. How should we modify our approach? Additionally, does this change the runtime? Explain why or why not.
